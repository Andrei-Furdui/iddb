#This file contains the log level that is used by the iDDB database
#If you want to change this file, the following should be taken into consideration:
# 1. each line which starts with "#" represents a comment and will be ignored
# 2. if you want to add a new log level:
# a. it must be documented
# b. all implementation should be changed accordingly
# see: ../../logger/c_logger/c_logger.c and ../../logger/python_logger/python_logger.py
# c. this pattern must be used: LOG_LEVEL = [TRUE|FALSE]
#
#
# for now only the debug level can be changed
DEBUG=TRUE
